      <h3>Purpose and Philosophy</h3>
      
      <p>The primary goals of this documentation framework are to enhance:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Providing clear insight into how generative AI was employed in research</li>
        <li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: Enabling other researchers to replicate findings and methods</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability</strong>: Creating a record of AI usage decisions and their rationale</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Integrity</strong>: Supporting rigorous research practices adapted for AI-assisted work</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>This checklist addresses the broad spectrum of generative AI applications in research, from text generation to image synthesis, from human-computer interaction studies to computational linguistics, and from financial analysis to economic forecasting and management studies.</p>
      
      <h3>Documentation Values</h3>
      
      <p>Effective AI documentation should be:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thorough</strong>: Document all aspects of AI usage, even those that seem obvious</li>
        <li><strong>Specific</strong>: Include exact details rather than general descriptions</li>
        <li><strong>Honest</strong>: Clearly acknowledge limitations and challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible</strong>: Write documentation that researchers from various backgrounds can understand</li>
        <li><strong>Forward-Looking</strong>: Consider how documentation will support future research building on your work</li>

3. Cleaning: Removed incomplete responses (23 out of 1,247 total responses)
4. Aggregation: Created summary statistics for key metrics

Input Structure:
- Formatted as CSV with 15 columns and 1,224 rows
- Column headers standardized to snake_case
- Missing values encoded as NULL
- Text responses truncated to 500 characters maximum

Data Selection:
- Filtered to include only responses from target demographic (ages 25-45)
- Selected 8 key questions from the full 32-question survey

  3. Clarity of explanation
  4. Adherence to financial reporting standards
- Used expert review panel of 3 financial analysts for final selection

Output Validation:
- Cross-referenced all numerical values with original financial statements
- Verified cited regulations and standards against current publications
- Conducted sentiment analysis to ensure neutral, objective tone

Performance Variability:
- Output Consistency: Standard deviation of 0.12 in quality scores across repeated generations
- Parameter Sensitivity: Temperature values >0.7 produced highly variable results
- Prompt Dependence: Minor wording changes in prompts led to 15-30% content variation
- Temporal Factors: Performance degraded by 8% for queries about events near knowledge cutoff date
- Statistical Measurement: Coefficient of variation calculated for key metrics (range: 0.05-0.22)

Model-Specific Limitations:
- Knowledge Cutoff: Model training data ends January 2023, limiting awareness of recent events
- Domain Gaps: Demonstrated limited knowledge of specialized biochemistry terminology
- Reasoning Constraints: Struggled with complex multi-step mathematical proofs
- Context Window: 8,000 token limit prevented analysis of complete lengthy documents
- Language Bias: Performed 23% better on English content compared to translated materials
- Hallucination Rate: Approximately 4% of factual claims contained inaccuracies

Sensitivity Analysis:
- Parameter Testing: Systematically varied temperature (0.0-1.0) and top-p (0.5-1.0)
- Input Variation: Tested 5 alternative phrasings for each key prompt
- Data Perturbation: Introduced controlled noise to input data (1%, 5%, 10%)
- Robustness Assessment: Measured output stability under various perturbation conditions
- Critical Thresholds: Identified parameter values where output quality significantly changed
- Confidence Intervals: Established 95% CI for all reported metrics

Observed Biases:
- Demographic Skew: Over-representation of Western perspectives in cultural analyses
- Temporal Recency: Stronger performance on recent (2015-2023) vs. historical (pre-2000) topics
- Publication Bias: Tendency to reference high-profile sources over specialized literature
- Sentiment Asymmetry: More nuanced analysis of positive vs. negative business outcomes
- Mitigation Attempts: Implemented countermeasures for 3 identified biases with partial success
- Residual Biases: Documented remaining biases that could not be fully mitigated
